# odin-Etch-a-Sketch

Hello again!

I did a new project of "The Odin Project" that consist in make a little sketch book.
Now the requirements of this project was make a grid of 16x16 that can be changed by the user, you will see a change size button.
The sketch will be colored in a random color for now and the opacity will be 10%, it will increment for every time you hover over the grid.
I've applied some flexbox in style.css buy almost the whole toy is styled in js document.

I hope you can enjoy this project!
